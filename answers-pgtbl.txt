> Explain the output of vmprint in terms of Fig 3-4 from the text. What does page 0 contain? What is in page 2? When running in user mode, could the process read/write the memory mapped by page 1?
- Page 0 contains the binary code of the `init` process.
- Page 2 contains the stack of the `init` process.
- When running in user mode, the process could not read/write the memory mapped by page 1 because PTE_U is not set.

> Explain why the third test srcva + len < srcva is necessary in copyin_new(): give values for srcva and len for which the first two test fail (i.e., they will not cause to return -1) but for which the third one is true (resulting in returning -1).
- This is to prevent unsigned integer overflow when the length is too long such that `srcva + len` is wrapped around.
- Example: `srcva = 0xff`, `len = 0xffffffffffffff01`
